<h1 align="center"> C++ </h1>
<p align="left"><i>C++</i> is a high-level, general-purpose programming language that was developed as an extension of the C programming language. It was created by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs in 1983, and is widely used for developing software applications, operating systems, device drivers, video games, and other systems that require high performance and efficiency.

C++ supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming, and provides features such as classes, templates, inheritance, polymorphism, and operator overloading. It also includes a rich set of libraries, such as the Standard Template Library (STL), which provides containers, algorithms, and other useful utilities for working with data structures and algorithms.

C++ is a compiled language, which means that the code written in C++ is translated into machine code by a compiler before it can be executed on a computer. C++ compilers are available for a wide range of platforms, including Windows, Mac, Linux, and other operating systems.

Overall, C++ is a powerful programming language that provides a balance of high-level abstraction and low-level control, making it a popular choice for a wide range of applications.</p>
